### What is Cryptography?
*"The art of writing or solving codes"*

*The aim of Cryptography is to encode a message using an algorithm, which can be reversed.*


### What is some Cryptography Terminology?

- **Plaintext** is the original message before encryption*
- ***Ciphertext** is the result of encryption, is an encrypted and not understandable version of the Plaintext*
- ***Encryption** is the general term for hiding information in secret code or cipher*
- ***Decryption** is the general term for extracting information, which was previously hidden*


### What is [[Caesar Cipher]]?


### What is the Keyspace?
*The set of all possible keys that can be used*

e.g.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V	V 
ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA

*The keyspace would be $26! = 4.03291461127á´‡26$*

***A LARGER KEYSPACE DOES MAKE A ENCRYPTION SAFE.***


### What is a [[Symmetric Cipher]]?


### What are the Assumptions made by Cryptography?

- *The rules could be obtained by the opponents*
- *The opponents may get a relatively large amount of encrypted messages*
- *The opponent may even get some snippets of plaintext and ciphertext pairs*


### What are the downsides of these Methods?
*Both people need to know the code in order to communicate.*


### What is the [[RSA Algorithm]]?
