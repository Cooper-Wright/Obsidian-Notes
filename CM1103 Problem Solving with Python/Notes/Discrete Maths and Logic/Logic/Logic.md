*Used in problem solving along with [[Discrete Maths]]*
##### What is Propositional Logic?

*A proposition is a sentence declaring a fact that is either **True** or **False**.*

*e.g. "n < 5" is not a proposition but "if n is 4, then n < 5" is a proposition*

##### What are the Logical Operators?


- Used in [[Truth Tables]]
- [[Negation]] = ¬
- [[Conjunction]] = Ʌ
- [[Disconjunction]] = V


- [[Exclusive|Exclusive or]] = ⨁
- [[Implication]] = ⇒
- [[Biconditional]] = ⇔


##### What are some ideas rules we can follow?

*We can follow: 
- The [[Contrapositive]], which is the idea that the opposite of the negative proposition; 
- The [[Converse]] where the opposite implication is the same;


### What do we call statements that are always True or always False?

[[Tautologies and Contraditons| Tautologies (Always True) and Contradictions (Always False)]]


##### What are some [[Logical Equivalence]]?
- *[[De Morgan's Laws]], which explains how you can get rid of brackets in Boolean algebra*
