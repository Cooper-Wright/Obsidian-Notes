##### What is the Goal of In-depth Interviews?
*To get specific information from people which cannot be achieved if the interviewing questions are too vague and instead you should ask for information that illustrates important aspects of the situation.*


##### How are In-Depth Interviews Planned?

1. **==Finding the Goal of the interview==:**
	- *Capture elements of experience or attitudes that are relevant to the research question*

2. **==Research Questions==:**
	- *Can you get the information by talking to people? If so then draw in their own experiences and beliefs.*

3. **==You will Need==:**
	- *Some Carefully designed interview Questions*
	- *A Carefully chosen sample*
	- *A rigorous approach to analysis*

4. **==Extra Tips==:**
	- *Do not **just** ask the research question, try to design the question to enable you to address it*
	- *When talking to someone treat it as a normal social interaction, this means:*
		- *Keep it short and to the point, using familiar language*
		- *Not leading with questions and instead keep it open instead*
		- *Keep it open to description and detail*
		- *Keep it grounded in **real** examples.*
