### What is The Majority Function?

*Given Three inputs A, B, C and an output X, the Majority Function outputs the number which has the highest occurrences e.g. if there were two 1's and a 0 then it would output 1*

### How is a Half-Adder Formed from Logic Gates?

*A Half-Adder preforms 1-bit addition but does not have a "carry"*

### How is a Full-Adder Formed from Logic Gates?

*This is constructed from [[The Structure of Computers#How is a Half-Adder Formed from Logic Gates?|Half-Adders]], this can be replicated to build adders for any word size.*

### What are Decoders and How do they Work?

*Decoders implement selection, where the value of the Binary is converted to the True value in Denary.*
