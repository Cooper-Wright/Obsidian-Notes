#### How to Write Requirements:

##### What are [[User Requirements|User Requirements (In-Depth)]]?
*They are what the customer needs from the system that the users may do, about the What not the HOW. This is done by analysing what the customer and other users <u>need the system to do</u>.

Also there needs to be an acceptance test as a criteria.


##### What is Requirement Engineering?
*The idea that at the start of designing a software you need to specify very high level requirements for the basis of the software and that each design feature has one requirement backing it up, making sure they are also <u>simple enough to be understood by anyone</u>.*

##### What are the different levels of requirements?
*The lower in the triangle you go the more detailed the requirements must be*

*[[User Requirements]] and [[System Requirements]]

##### Why is Requirements Engineering Difficult?

- *Since stakeholders may have difficulty __articulating__ what they want*
- *The Requirements may be in their own __domain__ of knowledge (in their own terms), and may not be easily understandable*
- *The Requirements may be __conflicting__, __incompatible__ or __impractical__*
- *The importance of the Requirements may __change__ from stakeholder to stakeholder*
- *__New__ Requirements may arise*

##### What is Requirement Elicitation?

This is where you working with the customers or end users or other stakeholders to find out about:
- *The application domain, this is the knowledge and terminology you must know that the stake holders will use to define the requirements for the system*
- The Services the system should provide
- The Constraints where it be standards, legal issues, hardware or software

Thus this is why gathering the requirements is the main challenge for developing a software  that fits the stakeholders needs/requirements.


##### What are the Sources of Requirements:

- *__Ask the users__ whether it be an interview, questionnaire or brainstorming*
- *__Observe__ to see what happens rather than what people say as people's words are subjective*
- *__Documents__ can provide information about the domain where forms tell you about data in a domain and a manual of procedures tells you how things are supposed to be done (remember this manual may not be kept up-to-date)*
- *__Scenarios__ are an integral part of agile methods and are descriptions of example interactions and they are easier to relate too from a users point of view, some techniques are use-case or UML models (can provide more detail)*
- *__Prototypes__ can be used to help clarify requirements*


##### What is Requirement Validation?

*The requirements specification needs to be validated to make sure that those requirements are all agreed upon by the stakeholders.*

The key criteria for requirement validation is whether the requirements are:
- *__Valid__ and correlate with the needs of the stakeholders*
- *__Unambiguous__ and cannot be misinterpreted*
- *__Complete__ and there is nothing left out*
- *__Consistent__ and there are no contradictions or conflicts with other requirements*
- *__Feasible__ and are possible to satisfy the requirements*
- *__Testable/verifiable__, meaning avoiding vague terms and are measurable where possible*

*Also the requirements specification needs to be used to develop the __User Acceptance Testing (UAT)__ of the system, where the UAT's must be a verifiable test criteria for each requirement to help eliminate confusion in the validation of the final product.*


##### How do you Specify [[User Requirements]]?

*First off there are two types of requirements:*
- *__[[Functional Requirements]]__ which are what the customer needs to the system to help them do (tangible)*
- *__[[Non-Functional Requirements]]__ which are what the customer needs to the system to be (properties)*

e.g. [[Functional Requirements]] is a system which *helps the customer calculate the money someone has spent in their store*, therefore the [[Non-Functional Requirements]] is the fact the system needs to *be quick to load and easy to train anyone* on etc.

***Using [[MoSCoW]]***


##### What are some Good Requirements?
*Requirements that are:** 
- *Not written down too early, e.g. before all the information on the system is known,*
- *Unambiguous and Testable*
- *Clear and Concise*
- *Consistent*
- *Attainable and Necessary*


##### How can you write Good Requirements?

*The user requirements must be:*
- *Verifiable*
- *Clear*
- *Concise, no more that 50 words in length*
- *Coherent/Consistent*
- *Unambiguous, only interpretable in one way*
- *Implementation-free*
- *Traceable, cannot be broken into smaller requirements*


##### What are some Other ways of showing Requirements?

*In such ways as [[User Stories]]*
