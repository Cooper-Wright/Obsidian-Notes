### The Thought of the Lecture:

```... the cost of hardware has halved every year whilst its complexity has, on average, quadrupled every three years ... the increase in complexity and decrease in cost are both of the order of one million since the mid-1960s. Equivalent progress in, for example, the motor industry, would have provided us with luxury cars requiring only half a gallon of petrol for life, having sufficient thrust to go into orbit, and a price tag of about twenty pence.```
*(Professor Stonham, 1987, “Digital Logic Design”)*
