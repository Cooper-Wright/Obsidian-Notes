### What are Memory Models?

1. *Architecture may require words to be aligned*
	- *Memory operates more efficiently this way*
	- *Two reads may be necessary to get non-aligned data*

2. *Pentium II has 36-bit physical addresses, but only 33 address bits are accessible*
	- *The last 3 bits are zero*
