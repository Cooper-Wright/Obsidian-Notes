##### What are Disjoint Sets?
*Two sets A and B are disjoint if they have **No Common Elements**, which means A ∩ B = ∅*


##### What are Partitions?
*A partition of a set A, is when another set P (which contains only subsets) where all of P's values are:*
- *Not empty*
- *Are all the union of A*
	- *e.g. if P = {A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>} then A<sub>1</sub> ∪  A<sub>2</sub> ∪  A<sub>3</sub> = A*
- *They are mutually disjoint, meaning that every par of sets are **Disjoint***
