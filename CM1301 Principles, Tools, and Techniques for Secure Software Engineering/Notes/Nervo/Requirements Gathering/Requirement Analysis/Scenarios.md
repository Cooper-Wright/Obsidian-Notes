##### What are Scenarios at the Application Level?

*"Scenarios are usually narratives that tell a story describing one or more tasks in a specific environmental situation"*
<strong>- where narratives means </strong>[[User Stories]]


##### What are Scenarios at the System Level?

*"A concise description of a 'persona' using a software-based product to achieve a goal"*
<strong>- where persona means </strong>[[User Persona]]


##### How do you Create Scenarios?

###### Who is the user?
- *remember the target user*
###### What are the specific tasks or activities?
###### Why does the user preform a specific task or activity or use a system?
- *remember the expectations or the motivation of the user*
###### What goals does the user have?
- *remember their specific needs*


##### What do you need to Remember when Creating a Scenario?

*That it should:*
- *include the goals, expectations, motivations, actions etc of the user*
- *Describe the real context*
- *Be based on research about the users*
- *Does not include yet system-specific solutions*


##### What are the Different Types of Scenarios?

- Goal-based or Task-based Scenarios
- Elaborated Scenarios
- Full Scale Task Scenarios
- Use Scenarios


##### What are Goal-based or Task-based Scenarios?

- States only what the user wants to do
- There is no information about how to do it
- Often used in a usability test

*e.g.,*
*Charles Xavier is arriving to Barcelona from Birmingham at 2am as his flight was delated for 4 hours. He **needs** some cash for the bus or taxi. He asks around for an ATM. At the ATM, he asks for €200 specifying that he would like to get the money in €20 bulls. He **does not want** a printed receipt.*


##### What are Elaborated Scenarios?

*A Scenario which is more detailed about the how, why and what of the situation*

*e.g.,*

##### What are Full Scale Task Scenarios?

- Include all the steps to accomplish the task
- How to support the goal-oriented scenarios
- From the user's perspective

*e.g.,*

##### What are Use Scenarios Scenarios?

*A story oe narrative, such as a [[User Persona]], to explore the set of tasks and interactions between types of users and the system*

*e.g.,*

##### What is Another way to Write User Requirements?

*Through use of the user's workflow through examples:*

Every Scenario should use the ==Given-When-Then== Template, this incudes:**
1. Defining the context (the ==Given=='s)
2. Describing an event that occurs within the system (the ==When=='s)
3. Ensuring that the expected outcomes take place (the ==Then=='s)

*e.g.,*
