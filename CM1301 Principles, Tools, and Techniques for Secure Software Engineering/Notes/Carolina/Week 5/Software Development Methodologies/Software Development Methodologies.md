### What are the Different Methodologies?

1. *[[Software Development Methodologies#The Waterfall Model|The Waterfall Model]]*
2. [[Software Development Methodologies#Prototyping|Prototyping]]
3. [[Software Development Methodologies#Iterative and Incremental Development|Iterative and Incremental Development]]
4. [[Software Development Methodologies#The Rational Unified Process (RUP)|The Rational Unified Process (RUP)]]


### How can I Choose which Model is Best?

- *Will collecting the requirements be easy or challenging*
- *Will the software have a long enough lifespan to require maintenance?*
- *What is the level of risk?*
- *What are some Scheduling constraints?*
- *What are the interactions between management and customers*
- *What are the expertise of the development team?*

### What are the Different Models?

### The Waterfall Model

**Pros**:
- *Works well when the requirements are understood well and are stable*
- *Allows for easy testing and analysis*
- *Structured approach, leads to an easy understanding and functionality*

**Cons**:
- *Not very flexible*
- *Not suitable for projects where programmers are not domain experts*
- *Not suitable for long and ongoing projects*
- *Only matches precise needs*


### Prototyping

#### What are the Two Different Types of Prototyping?

1. **Throwaway**
	- *Used to refine requirements.*
	- *Particularly useful for systems with an emphasis on user interface.*
	- *Inviting user feedback.*
	- *Often used when new technology is involved.*

2. **Evolutionary Prototyping**

![[Pasted image 20240303174124.png]]

- *First develop the parts they understand.*
- *Develop initial implementation exposing it to user comments.*
- *Refine it through repeating stages until an adequate system has been developed.*

**Pros**:
- *Gives clear idea about the functionality of the software.*
- *Reduces risk of failure in a software functionality.*
- *Assists well in requirement gathering and overall analysis.*

**Cons**:
- *Difficult to plan how long the project will take to complete.*
- *Excessive client involvement can affect the processing.*
- *Too many changes can affect the workflow of the software.*


### Iterative and Incremental Development

1. **Iterative Development**

2. **Incremental Development**

![[Pasted image 20240303175016.png]]


**Pros**:
- *Core capabilities are delivered early in the project.*
- *Core capabilities can be evaluated by the customer early in the project.*
- *A "safe" approach.*

**Cons**:
- *Can be difficult to split the problem into appropriate increments.*
- *System architecture has to be established before requirements are complete.*
- *Extra time must be spent on testing, documenting and maintaining "temporary" products until full system is delivered.*


### The Rational Unified Process (RUP)

#### What are the Principles of this?

#### What is the Philosophy of this?

- *The plan, design and team changes a little at a time.*
- *You should not plan, design or code more than needed at the moment so options remain open for the future.*
- *Do the simplest thing that works and meets current needs, do not build in extra complexity - **MVP - Minimum Viable Product**.*
- *As each piece is added, the developers learn what works and what does not.*
- *Customers learn what value the system offers and what features are needed next.*
- *The team should take pride in deliver a high quality product.*


#### What is XP (Extreme Programming)?

- *Extreme programming is identified by the fact that customer involvement in the software development process is unbelievably high.*
- *Coding*
	- *Pair programming*
	- *Code is reviewed by peers.*
- *Test Driven Development*
	- *Using automated unit testing*
	- *Acceptance testing*
	- *System wide integration testing*
