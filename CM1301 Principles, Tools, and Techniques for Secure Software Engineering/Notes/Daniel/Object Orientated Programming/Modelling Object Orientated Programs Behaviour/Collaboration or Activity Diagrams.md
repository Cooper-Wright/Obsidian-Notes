*This Diagram will be referred to as an "Activity Diagram" henceforth...*


##### What is an Activity Diagram?

- *Used to model behaviour, like a [[Sequence Diagrams]], but instead of time Activity diagrams **emphasise the flow of information***
- *Allows a more **formal and unambiguous description** of the activity*
- *Can also be used to **describe procedural logic** and **how operations are carried out** in the code*


##### What is an Example of an Activity Diagram?

##### What is Syntax for an Activity Diagram?

![[Pasted image 20240117151024.png]]

- **Initial Activity:** *This shows the starting point of the flow of activities*
- **Activity:** *A Square which can be a Task, or be described in action language*
- **Decisions:** *A Diamond which has written in square brackets on the emerging arrows*
- **End:** *End of the Activity*

- **Fork:** *Splits incoming flows into multiple, simultaneous, concurrent flows*

 - **Join:** *Synchronises multiple incoming flows*

- **Merge:** *Brings together different flows*
