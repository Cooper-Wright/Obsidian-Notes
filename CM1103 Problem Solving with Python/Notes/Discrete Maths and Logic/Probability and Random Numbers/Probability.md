##### What is an Event?
*An event is a subset of a sample space*


##### What is Probability?
*Given an experiment with a sample space S of ==equally likely== outcomes and an event E, the **probability** of E occurring is:*
$$P(E)=\frac{|E|}{|S|}$$


##### What is the Sum Rule?
$$P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)$$


##### What is the Probability of the Complement?
*Given an event E,*
$$P(NOT(E))=1-P(E)$$


##### What is the Conditional Probability?
*Given events A and B, define the ==conditional probability==, $P(A|B)$ (or the probability of A given B) by:*
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A∩B)}{P(B)}$$

##### What is the Product Rule?
$$P(A∩B) = P(A|B)P(B)$$
Note, if A and B are <em>independent</em> then,
$P(A|B)=P(A)$ *then*, $P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B)$


##### What is the Pigeonhole Principle?
*if $n+1$ objects are distributed among $n$ boxes, then at least one box must contain more than one object*
