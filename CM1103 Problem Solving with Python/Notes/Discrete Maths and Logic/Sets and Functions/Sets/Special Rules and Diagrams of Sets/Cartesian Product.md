##### What is the Cartesian Product?
*The Cartesian Product A x B of sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs, (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B:*
- A x B = {(a, b): a ∈ A and b ∈ B}

*e.g. if A = {w, x} and B = {y, z} then,*
		*A x B = {(w, y), (w, z), (x, y), (x, z)}*


##### What about if there are Three Initial Sets?
*e.g. if A = (u, v) B = (w, x). C = (y, z) then,*
		A x B x C = {(u, w, y), (u, w, z), (u, x, y), (u, x, z), (v, w, y), (v, w, z), (v, x, y), (v, x, z)}
