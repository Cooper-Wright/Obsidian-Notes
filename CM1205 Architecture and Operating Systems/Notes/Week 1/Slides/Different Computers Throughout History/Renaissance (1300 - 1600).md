### Who was John Napier?

![[Pasted image 20240201142436.png]]

*John was a Scottish landowner, thus was well off, also he was a mathematician, physicist and astronomer.*
*Napier was best know for the discovery of logarithms, which can turn multiplication and division into addition and subtraction.*

### Why did Napier wish to turn Multiplication and Division into easier tasks?
*As an important philosophy of mathematicians at the time was to*

	"turn unknown difficult problems into well-studied simple problems"

### What else did Napier Invent?
*Napier was tired of doing tedious multiplications thus he invented **"Napier's Bones" in 1617**. Although it does not include logorithms.*


### Why do Humans tend to Invent things that follow the Mathematicians Philosophy above?
	"turn unknown difficult problems into well-studied simple problems"

*Due to every humans inherent laziness they come together to create things that will same them time and energy which can be spent on things that would interest them more.*


### Since "Napier's Bones" did not use Logarithms who did and how?
***William Oughtred developed the Slide rule in 1621**, which utilises the fact that real numbers can be represented as distances or intervals on a line. Due to the Slide rule multiplication and division become accelerated.*

*These nifty inventions were still used through to the 1950s and 1960s but in 1974 the handheld electronic calculator made them largely obsolete.*
