##### What is the Expected value?
*For a given experiment, let X be a random variable with possible values from {x1, ..., xn}.*
**The expected value of X is denoted as E[X]** 

$$E[x] = x_1.P(X=x_1) + x_2.P(x=x_2)+...+x_n.P(X=x_n)$$


##### What is an Example of the Expected Value?
*Let X be the value rolled on a 6-sided dice*

*The chance that the dice lands on each side is equal thus,* $$P(X=x_1)=1/6$$
*So following the formula above you get,*
$$E[X] = 1.(1/6)+2.(1/6)+3.(1/6)+4.(1/6)+5.(1/6)+6.(1/6)$$
$$ = 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 + 4/6 + 5/6 + 6/6 = 21/6 = 3.5$$
*This means if you roll the dice many times the average number you will receive is most likely 3.5*


##### How can the Expected Value be used in a Question?

*Where if the gambler pays more than 91/6 or 15.166.... then they will most likely lose money.*


##### What is another way, Instead of the Formula, of finding the Expected Value?

*By using the [[Law of Large Numbers]], which says if you repeat the action many times then it will eventually get close to the expected value*
