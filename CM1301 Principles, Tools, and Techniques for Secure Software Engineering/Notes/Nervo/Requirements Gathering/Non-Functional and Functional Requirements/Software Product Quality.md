##### What is Software Product Quality?

*Well first off quality is defined as:*

> [!definition] 
> "The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy specified or implied needs."
> -- *ISO (1986)*

###### What does this imply?
- *This associates quality with the product or services ability to fulfil its function*
- Better quality directly relates to the features and characteristics of the product or service
- Therefore 'Quality is associated with both, <u>achieving a satisfactory performance within each attribute</u> and having the required <u>range of attributes</u>.'


##### What are the Factors of Product Operation that impact its Quality?

- **Reliability** *is a products ability to not fail which comes in three parts:*
	1. Accuracy is the precision of computations and output
	2. Consistency
	3. Error tolerance is the degree to which continuity of operation is ensured under adverse conditions e.g. exception handling

- **Efficiency** *is the amount of computer resources and code required by a program to perform its function and has two types:*
	1. Execution efficiency which is the run-time efficiency of the software
	2. Storage efficiency is the run-time storage requirements of the software

- **Integrity** *is the protection of the program from unauthorised access with two types:*
	1. Access audit is the ease in which software and data can be check for compliance with standards or other requirements
	2. Access control is the provision for control and protection of the software and data

- **Usability** *is the effort required to learn, operate and prepare inputs and interpret outputs of a program in three ways:*
	1. Communicativeness is the provision of useful inputs and outputs which can be easily understood, one way of testing this is by using [Schneiderman's principles and guidelines](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/shneiderman-s-eight-golden-rules-will-help-you-design-better-interfaces)
	2. Operability is the ease of operation of the software through good use of widgets and anticipating user errors.
	3. Training is how easily new users can understand and use the new system.


##### What are the Factors of Product Transition that impact its Quality?

- **Portability** *is the effort required to transfer a program from one environment to another and comes in two parts:*
	1. Hardware independence depends on how much the software is dependent on the underlying hardware
	2. Software system independence depends on how much the software is independent of its software environment e.g. operating system, libraries etc
