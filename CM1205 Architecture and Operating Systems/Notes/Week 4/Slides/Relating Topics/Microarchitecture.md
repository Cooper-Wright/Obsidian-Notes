*(AKA Microcode or Hardwired)*

### What does Microarchitecture consist of?

- *Registers*
- *Arithmetic Logic Unit*

*Where the ALU is connected to the registers by the data path.*


### What is the Data Path?

*The data path controls the data by sending data from the registers to the ALU, and storing the result back in some register.*


### What are Register?
*Small high-speed storage locations that the CPU can access more rapidly than main memory.*

### What is the are the Main ideas between Specialised Registers (Mention Examples) and General-Purpose Registers?

**Specialised**:
- *Program Counter (PC)*
- *Top of Stack*
- *Program Status Word (PSW)*

**General-Purpose Registers**:
- *Hold temporary results, meaning the CPU can avoid accessing memory while waiting*
- *Some general-purpose registers may also have specific functions*
