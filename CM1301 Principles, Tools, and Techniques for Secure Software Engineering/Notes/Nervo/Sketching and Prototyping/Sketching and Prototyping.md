##### What are the benefits of Sketching and Prototyping?

- *Validate assumptions and requirements*
- *Discover problems early*
- *Brainstorm ideas*
- *Design more iterations*
- *Conduct early usability testing*
- *Cheaper and faster to implement*
- *Shorten the feedback loop*
- *Disposable*
- *Helps communication between the team*
- *Ensure the right thing is being designed*


##### What happens after you Gather the Requirements?

*You should brainstorm and get ideas about how to tackle the problems or how to design the requirements, then you can think about the technological possibilities.*

*Look at the inspiring existing technologies*


##### What is the Design Studio Method?

##### Does Brainstorming always Guarantee the best ideas?

*Not necessarily but there are ways to optimise it...*

1. ==Teamwork:==
	- *defer judgement*
	- *encourage wild ideas*
	- *build on the ideas of others*
	- *stay focused on the topic*
	- *one conversation at a time*
	- *be visual*
	- *go for quantity*

##### What is the Difference between Sketching and Prototyping?

*They are both instantiations of a design concept but sketches are not prototypes entirely, where it is apart of the early ideation.*

##### What is High-fidelity and Low-fidelity prototyping?

*Low-fidelity prototypes are often paper-based and do not allow user interactions.*

*High-fidelity prototypes are computer-based and usually involves more realistic user interactions, which are as close as possible to a representation of the user interface.*

##### What are Wireframes (Low to Medium fidelity)?

- *Creates an outline representation of the key elements of the applications*
- *Interactivity is limited*
- *To provide an idea of the final prototype*

*Use a website such as [Creately](https://www.creately.com)*
