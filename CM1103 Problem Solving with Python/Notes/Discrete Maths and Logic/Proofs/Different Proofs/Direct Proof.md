##### What are some Examples of a Direct Proof?

1. *If $A ⊆ B$ and $B ⊆ C$, then $A ⊆ C$:*

Let $x ∈ A$, Since $A ⊆ B$, we have $x ∈ B$
Since $B ⊆ C$, we have $x ∈ C$
Therefore since $x ∈ A$ and $x ∈ C$, so $A ⊆ C$


2. *Prove that the sum of any two rational numbers is rational*

Let $r, s$ be any rational numbers.
By definition: rational numbers are quotient of integers, therefore,
$r = \frac{a}{b}$, and $s = \frac{c}{d}$ , where $a,b,c,d ∈ *Z*$ where b != 0 and d != 0.

Then,
$r+s = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}$

Therefore because the products and sums of integers are integers, therefore the addition of the rational numbers is a rational number.
