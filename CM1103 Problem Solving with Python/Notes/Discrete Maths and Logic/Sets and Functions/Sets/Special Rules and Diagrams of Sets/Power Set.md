##### What is the Power Set?
*The power set of a set **S**, denoted 𝒫(**S**), is the set of all <em><u>subsets</u></em> of **S***

*e.g. What is the 𝒫(**S**) if S = {1,2,3}:*
*𝒫(S) = {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}*

*As shown above the Power set is just the all the values of the set if the set is of length N, where N increments when no other set for that N is possible*

$$let, |S| = n$$
$$then, |𝒫(S)| = 2^n$$
