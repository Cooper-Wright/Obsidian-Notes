### Topic: Introduction to the Roots of Cyber Security
#### Overview: 
*A brief introduction to the Roots of Cyber Security*

### Definitions:



#### Subtopic 1 - Computer Security, The Creeper Virus

*Computer Security occurred from the 1950s to 1990s and was based on a small number of big computers where they focused on physically protecting computers.*

*In <span style="color:lightblue;">1971</span>, Bob Thomas created the first self-replicating program which affected 15 computers, which displayed the message below*

"I'm the creeper, catch me if you can"

#### Subtopic 2 - Information Security, Morris Worm

*Information Security occurred from the 1980s to 1990s and was based on everyone's personal computers, the internet, firewalls and encrypted traffic.*

*In <span style="color:lightblue;">1988</span>, the Morris worm was the first computer worm and was distributed by the internet, copying itself from one computer to another. This nearly wiped out the early internet and caused massive damage.*

#### Subtopic 3 - Cyber Security

*Cyber Security is occurring in the modern era, and focuses on protecting everything that is online and mostly protecting peoples personal details in the form as big data such as Google and Amazon.*

### Topic: Why are Information Security (InfoSec) and Cyber Security important?
#### Overview: 
*Briefly looking into the importance of both information and cyber security...*

### Definitions:

*Cyber Security - the ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks.*

#### Subtopic 1 - Why are both InfoSec and Cyber Security Important?

- *Information is a key asset in many organisations*
- *Growing dependence of organisations on the ICT Infrastructure*
- *The impact of security breaches have tangible and often devastating effects on businesses*

#### Subtopic 2 - What is Cyber Security?

*Although Cyber Security is mostly known as a Defence of private data by the use of computing knowledge and skill, there are many different roles and necessary skills needed for strong Cyber Security.*

#### Subtopic 3 - What was the Paradigm Shift from InfoSec to Cyber Security?

*Technology alone is now insufficient for solving the complex tasks of InfoSec, there are many Business needs, Human factors, Economic incentives and organisational aspects that should be taken into account...*

>The mantra of any good security engineer is: “Security is not a product, but a process.” It's more than designing strong cryptography into a system; it's designing the entire system such that all security measures, including cryptography, work together

>**Bruce Schneier**

#### Subtopic 4 - What are the Rules of the "Security Game", for Attackers vs. Defenders?

- *A defender must protect the system, preventing any attack or dealing with the consequences of an attack during all system life cycle. An attacker may attack the system at any time;*
-  *The defender must defend all points; the attacker can choose and attack only one - the weakest - point;*
- *The defender can defend only against known attacks; the attacker can probe for unknown vulnerabilities;*
- *The defender must be constantly vigilant; the attacker can strike at will;*
- *The defender must play by the rules and abide the law; the attacker does not follow any rules, he/she may play dirty.*

### Topic: What are the Key Concepts of Cyber Security?
#### Overview: 
*Looking at the key concepts of Cyber Security*

### Definitions:

- **Asset** – *A major application, general support system, high impact program, physical plant, mission critical system, personnel, equipment, or a logically related group of systems.*
- **Threat** – *Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. The potential source of an adverse event.*
- **Vulnerability** – *Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.*
- **Security Goals** – *The five security goals are confidentiality, availability, integrity, accountability, and assurance.*
- **Risk** – *The level of impact on organisational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organisational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring.*
- **IT Security Metrics** – *Metrics based on IT security performance goals and objectives.*
- **Countermeasure** – *Actions, devices, procedures, or techniques that meet or oppose(i.e., counters) a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.*

- **Confidentiality** - *“property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes” (internal disclosure, external disclosure)*
- **Integrity** - *“property of protecting the accuracy and completeness of assets” (accidental modification, deliberate modification, incorrect results, incomplete results)*
- **Availability** - *“property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity”(performance degradation, short-term/long-term interruption, total loss (destruction))*

- **Accountability** - *An ability of a system to hold users responsible for their actions (e.g. misuse of information)*
- **Auditability** - *An ability of a system to conduct persistent, non-by passable monitoring of all actions performed by humans or machines within the system*
- **Authenticity/Trustworthiness** - *An ability of a system to verify identity and establish trust in a third party and in information it provides*
- **Availability** - *A system should ensure that all system’s components are available and operational when they are required by authorised users*
- **Confidentiality** - *A system should ensure that only authorised users access information*
- **Integrity** - *A system should ensure completeness, accuracy and absence of unauthorised modifications in all its components*
- **Non-repudiation** - *An ability of a system to prove (with legal validity) occurrence/non-occurrence of an event or participation/non-participation of a party in an event*
- **Privacy** - *A system should obey privacy legislation and it should enable individuals to control, where feasible, their personal information (user-involvement)*

#### Subtopic 1 - What are the Key Security Concepts?

*Where threats can be Internal or External...*

#### Subtopic 2 - What are some Security Countermeasures?

*There are a wide ranges of countermeasures in Cyber Security, in the formats Technical, Administrational, Legal and Human-focused countermeasures.*

#### Subtopic 3 - What is the "Swiss Cheese" Model of Security?

![[Pasted image 20240415145703.png]]

#### Subtopic 4 - What are the Key concepts and Security Goals used within the CIA-triad (not linked)?

![[Pasted image 20240415145901.png]]

*In <span style="color:lightblue;">1975</span>, the CIA-triad came out with three Security Goals for Information Security,*
- *Unauthorised information release (Confidentiality)*
- *Unauthorised information modification (Integrity)*
- *Unauthorised denial of use (Availability)*

*Although this was not meant to be precise and comprehensive definition of Information Security, but was intended to convey the overarching goals instead.*
