## How do Java Programs Differ to Python Programs?

*Where as Python Programs use an interpreter to run them, allowing the computer to understand line by line, Java Programs use a compiler, allowing a computer to understand the program as a whole. (If you wish to run a Java file using an interpreter that us called a Java Virtual Machine).*

Also Programs in Java are either **Applets** or **Applications**:

- *Applets are programs run in web browsers*
- *Applications are programs run on a standalone computer*
