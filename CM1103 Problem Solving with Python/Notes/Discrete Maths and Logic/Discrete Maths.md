##### Why is it important in Computer Science?

- Computer Science is about problem solving
- Discrete Maths is commonly used in Computer Science, *e.g. the pixels in an image*  
- Mathematics is at the heart of problem solving
- Thus Maths and Computer Science are heavily linked through Computer Science
- Discrete Maths is used in all aspects of Computer Science
- For practicing abstract thinking
- This is all used along with [[Logic]] to solve and complete problems
