###### What is Moore's Law?

The observation that the number of transistors in dense integrated circuits doubles every two years, due to the constant decrease in size of the transistors.

###### How is Moore's Law coming to an end?

Since the common size of a transistor is about the same length as 100 silicon atoms across therefore is it possible for a transistor to be the size of an atom or even get any smaller? Whilst retaining its purpose.


###### Is there a possibility of a *New* Moore's Law?

According to Nvidia's CEO GPU's are 25x faster than 5 years ago whereas Moore's Law states that a CPU would have only expected a computer to be 10x faster.
