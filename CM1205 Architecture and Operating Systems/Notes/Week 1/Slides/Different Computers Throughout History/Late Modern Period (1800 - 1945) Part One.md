*So far from this point all modern computer scientists have seen nothing but calculators and not computers, but what is forgotten is computer used to be a job title for someone who preformed calculations.*


# The Nineteenth Century (1800)
## The Father of Computing, Charles Babbage...
*Babbage was an English mechanical engineer and polymath, who originated the concept of a programmable computer. Then he went on to invent this first mechanical computer in the early 19th century*

*After working on **The Difference Engine (in 1822)** he realised (in 1833) that a much more general design for a computer, **The Analytical Engine** was possible. Yet his ideas where too far ahead of the possibilities of the his time and thus it was never put into production.*


### What is the Difference Engine?
*It is a Babbage's challenge against the idea of having error free mathematics which could be use for "computers" (job title) for better computation.*


### What is the Analytical Engine?
*The engine included an arithmetic logic unit, control flow and integrated memory, thus making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described as **"Turning-Complete"**.*

*Another feature was that the engine was programmable, via punched cards, and thus can be used in multiple different ways. For the output the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell which allowed it to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.*

*It also employed ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic unlike modern computers.*



## The First Computer Programmer, Ada Lovelace...
*Augusta Ada King, countess of Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer known for her work on Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, The Analytical Engine*

*Ada was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the potential of a **"Computing Machine"**.*



### Boolean Algebra, George Boole...

*The mathematical basis of digital computing is within Boolean Algebra, developed by **George Boole in his 1854 book "The Laws of Thought"**, that stated that Logic can be equated to Arithmetic and that True = 1 and False = 0.*
