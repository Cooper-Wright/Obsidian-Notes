### Why are we learning (Boring) History?

- *History is not boring, if it is taught in the right way, as it is actually an interesting collection of stories*
- *History is also useful as you can learn my imitation and imagination, such as how certain computers were made.*
- *To some extent, all things you can learn are history.*


### Where can we find Materials for History?
