##### What is the Logic behind Proof by Contradiction?

*To prove the statement P is True, then prove NOT P is False*


##### What is the Method to Proof by Contradiction?

1. *Suppose the negation of the Statement is True*
2. *Show that this supposition leads logically to a Contradiction*
3. *Conclude that the Statement to be proved is True*


##### What are some Examples of Proof by Contradiction?

1. *There is no greatest integer.*

Suppose there is a greatest integer $N$

Then $N >= n$ for every integer $n$. Let $M = N + 1$. Now $M$ is an integer, since it is a sum of integers, also $M > N$ since $M = N +1$.

Therefore $M$ is a greater integer than the greatest integer $N$ thus this is a **contradiction**.

Therefore there is no greatest integer.
