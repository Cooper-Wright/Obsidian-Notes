To subtract using binary there are a few rules to follow similarly to binary addition:

##### Rules for Binary subtraction:
- 0 - 0 = 0
- 1 - 1 = 0
- 1 - 0 = 1
- 0 - 1 = Carry from the closest left bit and subtract.


###### Example:
$$ 1001 - 0100 $$
$$ = 0101 $$

> [!tip]  
> When 0 - 1 happens you carry over the digits from the closest 1 on the left
