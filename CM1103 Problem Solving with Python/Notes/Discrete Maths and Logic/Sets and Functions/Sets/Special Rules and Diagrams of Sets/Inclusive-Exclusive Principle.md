##### What is the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle?
*This is the idea for how to find the number of ( | | ) elements in the union (∪) of two sets using the number of elements that the two sets share (∩) and the number of elements each set has*

- *For two (finite) sets A and B:*
	- *| A ∪ B | = | A | + | B | - | A ∩ B|*

- *For three (finite) sets A, B, and C:*
	- *| A ∪ B ∪ C | = | A | + | B | + | C | - | A ∩ B| - | A ∩ C | - | B ∩ C | + | A ∩ B ∩ C |*
