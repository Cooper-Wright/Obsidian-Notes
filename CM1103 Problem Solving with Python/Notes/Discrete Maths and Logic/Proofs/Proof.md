##### When do you Use each Proof?

*Look at the statement and if it is a universal statement then you can find a [[Disproof by Counter example|Counter example]].*
*If not then can you prove it directly using definitions or theorems you already know, using [[Direct Proof]]?*
*Are there more than one cases in the hypotheses? The use [[Proof by Cases]].*
*If direct proof seems difficult, then think about indirect proof.*
*Is it easier to prove by [[Proof by Contradiction]]?*
*Is it easier to be proven with [[Proof by Contraposition]]?*
