##### What are Non-Functional Requirements?
*what the customer needs the system to be (properties)*


##### What are some key features of Non-Functional Requirements?

- *It can relate to all, some or just one specific function carried out by the system*
- *It may define **constraints**, **characteristics** or **quality** of the system*
- *It may relate to emergent system properties*
- *They can be subdivided into:*
	1. *Product requirements (performance, reliability etc)*
	2. *Organisational requirements (standards, policies etc)*
	3. *External requirements (legal, ethical etc)*

##### What are some Non-Functional Requirements that are difficult to verify, since they are ambiguous?
That the system:
- is *Easy to use*
- *is User-friendly*
- *has rapid user response*
- *should minimise user error*

The reason these are difficult, but not impossible, to verify is the tests are quantifiable. Such as the system should mean an average of two mistakes or less are make by trained operators etc.


##### How are [[Functional Requirements]] and Non-Functional Requirements linked?
*The Non-Functional Requirements are often apart of the acceptance criteria for the [[Functional Requirements]]*

e.g.

Where the [[Functional Requirements|Functional Requirement]] is "Todd and Gina MUST be able to open the Dog Door flap to let the dog through" and the Non-Functional Requirements are the Acceptance Criteria


##### What is [[Software Product Quality]]?
*[[Software Product Quality]] explains how quality is defined through multiple different factors.*
