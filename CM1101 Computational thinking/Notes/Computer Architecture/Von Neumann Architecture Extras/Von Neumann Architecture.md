###### An overview of the Von Neumann architecture:
- Early computers were not (re)programmable since they would require a full rebuild to be changed so Vonn Neumann suggested that programs and data should be stored in the memory *(stored-program concept)*
- Most modern computers use this concept where they treat programs as data itself

###### What are the five different components?
1. Memory unit
	- Memory is a collection of cells each with a unique address used to identify the cell
	- The number of bits in each addressable location is known as the memory's addressability

2. Input unit
	- Allows data and programs to be entered into the computer such as any peripherals etc

3. Output unit
	- Allows data and programs to be outputted from the computer such as printing and screens

4. Arithmetic logic unit *(ALU)*
	- Capable of preforming basic arithmetic operations
	- The ALU also includes register to store information that is needed again immediately

5. Control unit
	 - This is the organising force of the computer and control the FDE cycle
	 - This also stored the Program counter and the Current Instruction register


###### How is the CPU designed (simplified)?

###### What is the difference between the GPU and CPU design?

> [!Analogy] 
> **GPU is the office worker and the CPU is the brain behind the office**

###### Can fast computer really be big?

Since signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light (3 x10^8), so the bigger the computer the further and thus slower the date travels, therefore instead of making computers bigger they are miniaturised

###### What is Moore's Law?
