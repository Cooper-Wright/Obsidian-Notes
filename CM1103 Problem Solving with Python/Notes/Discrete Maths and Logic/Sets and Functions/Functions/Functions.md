##### What are Functions?
*Let A and B be non-empty sets where a function ```f: A -> B``` is a relationship between **elements** of A and B, such that each element of A (a ∈ A) is related to exactly one element of B (f(a) ∈ B)*


##### What is a Domain?
*if ```f: A -> B``` is a function then A is the domain of ```f``` and Bis the co-domain*

- **Domain:** *The set that is applied to the co-domain*
- **Co-Domain**: *The set that the domain is applied onto*

*e.g. the function, a - b has the domain **b** and the co-domain **a**, as **b** is applied to **a** through the operator.*


##### What are the Main Different Functions?

- **Squaring Function:**
	- *f: ℝ -> ℝ*, defined by f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>

- **Successor Function:**
	- *f: ℤ -> ℤ, defined by f(x) = x + 1*

- **Constant Function** *(example)***:**
	- *f: ℚ -> ℤ, defined by f(x) = 2 for all rational number "x"*

- **Identity Function:**
	- *X, i<sub>x</sub>: X -> X, defined by i<sub>x</sub>(x) = x for all x in X*


##### What are the Different types of Functions?

- **Injective functions:**
	- *A function, f: A -> B, is an injective (one-to-one) function if and only if f(a) != f(b), whenever a != b*
	- *e.g. the function times_two(x) should never equal the same number for each argument*
	- *one e.g. for a non-injective function is the square_root(x) function where x = -1 is equal to x = 1*

- **Surjective Functions:**
	- *A function, f: A -> B, is a surjective (onto) function if and only if for every b there is an element a e.g. f(a) = b*
	- *e.g. the function times_two(x) always has a output such as if x = 2 then the output is 4*
	- *one e.g. for a non-surjective function is the function num_divide_num(x, y) where if x = n and y = 0 then the answer is "undefined" thus is not and surjective function*

- **Bijective Function:**
	- *A function, f: A -> B, is a bijective function (one-to-one <u><em>correspondence</em></u>) if it is both injective and surjective*
	- *e.g. the function times_two(x), as shown above, is both injective and surjective.*
