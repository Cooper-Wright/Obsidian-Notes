- *Reliable, i.e. the results are stable across multiple administrations of the instrument*
- *Valid, i.e. the questionnaire measures what it say it is measuring*
- *Usability, i.e. for respondent and the researcher*

1. **==Questionnaire Purpose==:**
	- *What is the purpose of the survey? As writing the questions should not be the first thing on your mind.*

	*The potential pitfalls are:*
	- Failing memory of the respondents
	- Effect of fatigue, boredom or time pressure
	- Social desirable replies
	- Respondent does not want to appear stupid
	- "Please the researcher" effect


3. **==Question Content==:**
	- What information is needed?


4. **==Question Wording==:**
	- *Questions should be simple, i.e. they should be simple (not too simple), clear, unambiguous, relevant to the topic, brief (not too brief) and use neutral language*
	- ***Avoid:***
		- *Negative wording or emotional language*
		- *Biased, leading and double-barrelled questions*
		- *Over asking questions*
		- *Asking hypothetical questions*
		- *Asking for solutions to complex ideas*
		- *Controversial questions*


5. **==Question Format==:**
	- **Closed-Ended:**

6. **==Question Sequence==:**
	- **Self-administered:**
		- Start: Interesting questions
		- Middle (-> End): Less Interesting
		- End: Personal information
	- **Interview:**
		- Start: Least Threatening questions
		- Middle: Most Personal questions
		- End: Less Sensitive


7. **==Questionnaire Length==:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20231128003546.png]]
	- Keep it simple


9. **==Questionnaire Layout==:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20231128003552.png]]

- *Too many words*
- *Not keeping their vocabulary accessible, using too many ==BIG== words*
- *Thinking the participants are definitely interested in the project*
- *Not asking for feedback*
- *Not checking the literature or the market*
- *No brainstorming*
