*Similar to the CM1103'S [[Proof]]*

### What does "Proof" mean?
- *Oxford English Dictionary*
	- **Generic** - *"Something that proves a statement; evidence or argument establishing a fact or the truth of anything..."*
	- **Math and Logic** - *"A sequence of steps by which a theorem or other statement is derived from a given premises."*

*A proof is not open to interpretation, if it is correct then it is indisputible.*


### What is a Theorem?
- *"The statement whose validity you are trying to prove with proofs"*


### What are [[Direct Proof|Direct Proofs]]?

*Direct proof start with a premise of the statement you want to prove, or a Theorem. Where known or previously proven facts are used to logically prove or disprove the statement.*


#### What is the form of a Direct Proof?

*Form:*
1. *"If a is true"*
2. *"Then b must also be true (because...)"*
3. *"If b is true, then c must also be true (because...)"*
4. *Repeat until you get to the statement to be proved.*


#### What is an Example of this?

**Theorem:**
- *"If an integer, $n$, is odd, then $n^2$ is also odd."*

*First, do we understand the vocabulary?*
- e.g. $n = 3$ then $n^2 = 9$ since they are both odd

*What does it mean that $n$ is odd?*
- *That $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$*

*Next, what is $n^2$?*
- $n^2 = (2k+1)(2k+1) = 4k^2+4k+2$

*What can we do to show that $n^2$ is odd?*
- *Show it in the form $2m+1$ for some integer $m$*
- **Do not use $k$ (or the previously stated value as they are different values)**

- $n^2 = 2(2k^2+2k) + 1$
- *So $n^2$ can be shown in the format $2m+1$ where $m = 2k^2 + 2k$*

*Final statement:*
- *Any number that can be written in this form is odd, therefore $n^2$ is odd*
