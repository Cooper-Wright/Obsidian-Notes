##### What is the Logic behind Proof by Contraposition?

*To prove statement "if P then Q", we prove "if NOT Q then NOT P".*


##### What is the Method of Proof by Contraposition?

1. *Express the statement in the form "if P then Q"*
2. *Rewrite the statement in the contrapositive form "if NOT Q then NOT P"*
3. Suppose NOT Q is True and prove NOT P is True


##### What are some Examples of Proof by Contraposition?

*For all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is even then n is even.*

Suppose $n$ is an odd integer, therefore according to the proposition $n^2$ must be odd as well.

By definition $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.
Then $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$
Since $k$ is an integer then $2k^2 + 2k$ must also be an integer.
Therefore $n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k)+1 = 2m + 1$ where m is an integer
So by definition when $n$ is an odd integer, $n^2$ is also an odd integer
